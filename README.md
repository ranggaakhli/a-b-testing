# a-b-testing
A company wishes to know whether its new landing page performs better than the old one in terms of user conversion. it applies a/b testing to know the answer.

After doing it, a/b test found that:
- The z-score is negative, meaning the new page is slightly worse than the old page
- Conversion rate is not statistically significant
- For business, we can conclude no performance gain from the new page
- No need to deploy the new page anymore because it gives no clear uplift conversion
- Should there will reconsider using another new page, please reevaluate the design based on user behaviour insight
